            Established in 1930, the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) is the governing body for cricket in Mumbai, Greater Mumbai and Thane districts. MCA is a permanent member of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), and houses its headquarters within the Wankhede Stadium premises.            </p>
            <p className="text-[#D1D1D1] font-semibold text-[20px] leading-[35px] pt-4 font-[Plus Jakarta Sans]">
            MCA has developed a rich cricket heritage in Mumbai. Such has been their influence that Mumbai has given the country more than 60 Test cricketers so far. There was even a time when the Indian playing eleven consisted of six to seven cricketers from Mumbai – a testament to how good they have been at the highest level.            </p>
            <p className="text-[#D1D1D1] font-semibold text-[20px] leading-[35px] pt-4 font-[Plus Jakarta Sans]">
            MCA has taken on the onus of building new infrastructure for cricket. They have developed Recreation Centres at the Bandra Kurla Complex, and also in Kandivali where they house some of the best, cutting-edge sports facilities.            </p>
